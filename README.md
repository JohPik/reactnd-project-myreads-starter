# MyReads Project

This web app is the first React project of Udacity's Front-end Nanodegree. In this app, the user can [`search`](#search) for books, add books to three shelves, *Currently Reading*, *Want To Read* and *Read*. Finally, the user can move the books from one shelf to another.

## Before Starting

To use the app, download the [Github repository](https://github.com/JohPik/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/archive/master.zip). you will need to have NPM installed on your machine to run the app.

### then
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* the app will open in you favorite browser at http://localhost:3000/(http://localhost:3000/)


## Using the App

### Book `search`
1. Click + button in the bottom right corner
2. Update text field.  
#### Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

### Add a book to shelf or update a book's shelf
1. Clicked on the green drop down menu located in the bottom right corner of the book cover.
2. Select the shelf

### Remove a book from a shelf
1. Clicked on the green drop down menu located in the bottom right corner of the book cover.
